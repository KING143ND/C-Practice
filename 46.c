// Uses of Pointers:
// * Dynamic Memory Allocation

// * Arrays, Functions and Structures

// * Return multiple values from a function

// * Pointer reduces the code and improves the performance

 

// Thatâ€™s all about basics of Pointers. In next tutorial we will discuss about Pointers Arithmetic i.e. how to manipulate pointers values.
