// Null Pointer :
// * A pointer that is not assigned any value but NULL is known as NULL pointer.
// * In computer programming NULL pointer is a pointer that does not point to any object, variable or function.
// * We can use it to initialize a pointer variable when that pointer variable isnâ€™t assigned any valid memory address yet.
// * int *ptr = NULL;
